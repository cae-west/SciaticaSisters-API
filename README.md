[SciaticaSisters API Documentation](https://cae-west.github.io/SciaticaSisters-API)

The SciaticaSisters API helps developers make tools and apps for people with chronic back and leg pain.
Patients can track their symptoms and note changes to their pain over time. The API also helps them
find patterns in how they heal. This project is part of a portfolio for a program at the University
of Washington. You can use the API with a local JSON server or with any online server. Visit the
docs page to get started.
